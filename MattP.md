# Matt Poloni

Three words that describe me:
1. Mindful
2. Flexible
3. Resilient

My favorite movie is [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071853/). I honestly believe that it should be considered required viewing for anyone who claims to have a sense of humor.

# Patrick Maloney (alternate reality)

Three words that describe me:
1. Self-centered
2. Rigid
3. Fragile

My favorite type of movies are dramas with absolutely no humor mixed in. Laughter is overrated.
